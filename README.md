Prayer Streaks is a simple, offline-first NativeScript app that helps users
build a daily prayer habit by tracking check-ins and streaks. The app lets
you log "I prayed today," view your current streak and recent history, and
optionally tag each day with a prayer type (for example, Rosary, Scripture,
Mass, or Adoration). Designed as a lightweight, data-driven demo for Norrix,
it supports fast iteration through over-the-air updates, remote
configuration, release channels, and rollbacks without requiring a new binary
release.
